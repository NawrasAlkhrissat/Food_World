## Food World Project

**Food World** is a project that closely resembles my first project, [**TV Show**](https://github.com/NawrasAlkhrissat/TV-SHOW), in both design and concept. Similar to the first project, it allows users to perform key operations such as:

- Adding new food items
- Editing existing food items
- Deleting food items

### What Makes Food World Different?

The main difference between **Food World** and my previous [**TV Show**](https://github.com/NawrasAlkhrissat/TV-SHOW) project lies in the technical approach:

1. **Simplified Architecture**: While the **TV Show** project utilized back-end technologies and a database, **Food World** is built entirely using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**—without any back-end or database integration.

2. **Single Page Implementation**: In this project, all operations (add, edit, delete) are performed on a single page, offering a seamless user experience.

3. **Local Storage**: Instead of using a database, I leveraged the browser's **local storage** to store and manage the food items. This approach allowed me to keep the data persistent across sessions without requiring a back-end setup.

### Personal Challenge & Outcome

I challenged myself to recreate the functionality of my first project but with a more streamlined and minimalistic approach. Implementing all CRUD operations on a single page without relying on any back-end technologies was both a **fun** and **slightly challenging** experience—but ultimately, I successfully completed the project.

This project not only improved my understanding of front-end development but also enhanced my ability to manage data locally and deliver a smoother user experience.
